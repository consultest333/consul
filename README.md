This is the opensource code repository of the eParticipation website CONSUL, originally developed for the Madrid City government eParticipation website

## Documentation

Check the ongoing documentation at [https://docs.consulproject.org](https://docs.consulproject.org) to learn more about how to start your own CONSUL fork, install it, customize it and learn to use it from an administrator/maintainer perspective.

## CONSUL Project main website

You can access the main website of the project at [http://consulproject.org](http://consulproject.org) where you can find documentation about the use of the platform, videos, and links to the community space.

## Configuration for development and production environments:

Install docker engine:
- Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:
```bash
 sudo apt-get update

 sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
```

- Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

- Use the following command to set up the repository:
```bash
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

- Update the apt package index, and install the latest version of Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose:
```bash
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
```

*https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
*https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

- Install docker-compose:
```bash
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.15.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)"
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

- Clone the repo to your computer and enter the consul folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/consultest333/consul.git
cd consul
```

- Then lets create our secrets and database config files based on examples:
```bash
cp config/secrets.yml.example config/secrets.yml
cp config/database-docker.yml.example config/database.yml
```

### Build the database volume 
```bash
./build_db.sh
docker compose down
```
This will create the volume `consul_db_data` filed with the default data.

- Start application with docker-compose:
```bash
sudo POSTGRES_PASSWORD=consul docker-compose up
```

## Frontend login credentials:
You can use the default admin user from the seeds file:

 **user:** admin@consul.dev
 **pass:** 12345678

But for some actions like voting, you will need a verified user, the seeds file also includes one:

 **user:** verified@consul.dev
 **pass:** 12345678

## Current state

Development started on [2015 July 15th](https://github.com/consul/consul/commit/8db36308379accd44b5de4f680a54c41a0cc6fc6). Code was deployed to production on 2015 september 7th to [decide.madrid.es](https://decide.madrid.es). Since then new features are added often. You can take a look at the current features at the [project's website](http://consulproject.org/) and future features at the [Roadmap](https://github.com/consul/consul/projects/6) and [open issues list](https://github.com/consul/consul/issues).
